    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Lemon, and this is my school portfolio. I created The Lemon Garden to showcase my academic journey,
      projects, and the skills I've developed along the way. Here, you'll find my work, experiences, and the things
      that inspire me to keep learning and growing.
